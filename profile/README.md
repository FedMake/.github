## What is FedMake
Microsoft Federal's FedMake program delivers hackathon style events, exclusively for Federal (Civilian / DoD / Intel) organizations, where conditions are created (and facilitated by Microsoft experts) for cross-organization teams to leverage Microsoft expertise and develop solutions that achieve their mission.

## Our Mission
Empower every person and every mission to achieve more.

<!--FedMake has 4 core principles that differentiate our events from others:-->
## Our Approach

1. ### Mission Focused
      Whether it be specific executive orders or an organization's overall mission, FedMake events focus on outcomes.  Microsoft is uniquely positioned to help organization's achieve their mission with our portfolio of cloud services.  We want to empower our FedMake participants with the knowledge of how to leverage their existing investment, and any additional capabilities available, to build solutions in the United States sovereign clouds.

2. ### Cross-Organization Collaboration
      Federal entities have long discussed the importance of cross-organization collaboration. But recent changes in law and advances in technology have led to a new environment that makes it far more achievable.  Participants of FedMake events will be broken into teams consisting of members outside their organization.  Together they will connect and gain insight of their common challenges, understand how other federal organizations are dealing with them, and build innovative solutions that address them.

3. ### Make It Real
      Have you ever attended a training on a new technology but were unsure how you could apply it to addresss your unique challenges?  ***...Not at FedMake.***  FedMake events are hands-on, where participants have the opportunity to bring their real world problems, and build a solution that solves them.  

      Have you ever been shown capabilities, just to find out they are only available in our commercial clouds? **...Not at FedMake.**  FedMake coaches are extremely knowledgeable on the capabilities in the United States sovereign clouds.

4. ### Embrace the Makers
      The Makers. The FedMake program leans into the DIY Maker Movement to empower every person and every mission to achieve more. We have the tools; our customers have the motivation and imagination. We want to empower those who understand a challenge best because we know that they are the same people best equipped to solve them.

## Looking For More Reasons to Attend?
Don't take our word for it.  Listen to your peers who attended our first event.

We asked previous event participants... *__'What would you most like to communicate to others about this event?'__*

-	It was an amazing event where different agencies come together to discuss situations unique to the federal government.  Microsoft provided expert recommendations on how these situations can be addressed.  We built an app live so we were able to hear how other programmers tackle problems and learn from them, as well as the coaches teaching us solutions and tips during the entire process.  Countless resources were provided to us.  Individual attention was provided so no one walked away with unanswered questions.  
-	Usually when people attend events like this, they arrive late and try to leave early.  This was not the case with most people arriving early and staying after hours.  People wanted to work longer because it was that valuable.  It was well worth the time and money invested in me travelling in for the event.  I hope to attend in the future again because I think the knowledge I gain to develop additional skills would be worth it. 
-	Opportunity to network with Microsoft staff. Expose to new Microsoft technology. Learned from others. 
-	It is a way to get direct help and guidance from MS team members.
-	The number of resources available to help you.
-	Like minded individuals to share your passion with.
-	Valuable learning experience and networking opportunities with Microsoft employees in federal. Great to learn and increase power platform skills.
-	This event was a great way to practice, learn, and improve your skills for those with and without much experience.
-	It's hugely impactful for anyone. Better sharing/marketing of the event in advance.
-	Practical application in the Gov cloud environment, networking, discussions with peers and professionals.
-	Thank you to everyone at Microsoft for all your support and encouragement.  I have already implemented so much of what I have learned!
