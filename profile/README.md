## What is FedMake
The Microsoft Federal's FedMake program delivers hackathon style events, exclusively for Federal (Civilian / DoD / Intel) organizations, where conditions are created (and facilitated by Microsoft experts) for cross-organization teams to leverage Microsoft expertise and develop solutions that achieve their mission.

## Our Mission
Empower every person and every mission to achieve more.

<!--FedMake has 4 core principles that differentiate our events from others:-->
## Our Approach

1. ### Mission Focused
      Whether it be specific executive orders or an organization's overall mission, Microsoft Federal's FedMake events focus on outcomes.  Microsoft is uniquely positioned to help organization's achieve their mission with our portfolio of cloud services.  We want to empower our FedMake participants with the knowledge of how to leverage their existing investment, and any additional capabilities available, to build solutions in the United States sovereign clouds.

2. ### Cross-Organization Collaboration
      Federal entities have long discussed the importance of cross-organization collaboration. But recent changes in law and advances in technology have led to a new environment that makes it far more achievable.  Participants of Microsoft's FedMake events will be broken into teams consisting of members outside their organization.  Together they will connect and gain insight of their common challenges, understand how other federal organizations are dealing with them, and build innovative solutions that address them.

3. ### Make It Real
      Have you ever attended a training on a new technology but were unsure how you could apply it to addresss your unique challenges?  ***...Not at FedMake.***  Microsoft Federal's events are hands-on, where participants have the opportunity to bring their real world problems, and build a solution that solves them.  

      Have you ever been shown capabilities, just to find out they are only available in our commercial clouds? **...Not at FedMake.**  Microsoft Federal's FedMake coaches are extremely knowledgeable on the capabilities in the United States sovereign clouds, and will only discuss the capabilities availble in them.


4. ### Embrace the Makers
      The Makers. Microsoft Federal's FedMake program leans into the DIY Maker Movement to empower every person and every mission to achieve more. We have the tools; our customers have the motivation and imagination. We want to empower those who understand a challenge best are the same people best equipped to solve them.
