# FedMake

## What is FedMake
The FedMake program is an in-person, hackathon style event, exclusively for Federal (Civilian / DoD / Intel) organizations, where conditions are created (and facilitated by Microsoft experts) for cross-agency teams to leverage Microsoft expertise and develop solutions on Microsoft 365 that satisfy the data classification aspects of the executive orders.
